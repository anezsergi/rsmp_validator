Verify that we change time plan (signal program)
We try switching all programs configured

1. Given the site is connected
2. Verify that there is a Validator.config['validator'] with a time plan
3. Send command to switch time plan
4. Wait for status "Current timeplan" = requested time plan

```ruby
plans = Validator.config['items']['plans']
skip("No time plans configured") if plans.nil? || plans.empty?
Validator::Site.connected do |task,supervisor,site|
  prepare task, site
  plans.each { |plan| switch_plan plan }
end
```
