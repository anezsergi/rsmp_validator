# Automated RSMP Validation ✔︎

Automatic testing of RSMP implementations, based on Ruby and RSpec.

Road authorities that purchase RSMP equipment of systems can use the validator to assess the quality and completeness of RSMP interfaces.

Suppliers can use the validator as an aid during development of RSMP interfaces.

The validator is maintained as open-source by [RSMP Nordic](https://rsmp-nordic.org), the partnership behind the RSMP protocol.

## Benefits
* The validator will help you implement/use RSMP according to the RSMP specification.
* Automated testing is much faster than manual testing and can be run more often.
* With automated testing, more edge cases and can be checked.
* Because it's based on RSpec, there's a lot of convenient options for filtering specs, configure output, etc.
