# Documenation Flow

## Jekyll
The general documenentation is written in Markdown and structure as Jekyll site located in docs/. It's published on Github Pages.

To update the general documentation, edit Markdown files in docs/ and commit to the master branch.

When you push the master branch to GitHub, a GitHub Action will update the  gh-pages branch. GitHub pages automatically rebuilds and publishes the site from the gh-pages branch.

## YARD
The documentation of the RSpec test suite, including specs and helper methods, is generated by YARD. The documentation is written as comments in the RSpec specification files in spec/

To update the YARD documentation, edit comments in RSpec spec files in spec/ or Ruby files in spec/support/. 

If you wan to review the generated documentation locally, first run the `yardoc` command to rebuild the YARD documentation. Then either view the generated Markdown files, or use the `jekyll server` command to server the Jekyll site and view it on localhost port 4000.

Note that the folder `docs/dev/` is gitignored.

When you push the master branch to GitHub, a GitHub Action will update the run `yardoc` to update the files in `docs/dev`, and commit the update to the gh-pages branch. 

When the gh-pages branch is updated, GitHub pages automatically rebuilds and publishes the Jekyll site, which includes the html sub-site generated by YARD.
