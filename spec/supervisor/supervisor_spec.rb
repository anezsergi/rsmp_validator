# Tests for RSMP supervisors.
# Supervisor testing is still preliminary, and only a small set of tests are available,
# covering just the core specification. No tests are available for specific equipment types, e.g.
# Traffic Light Controllers.
#
# When testing a supervisor the validator will run a local RSMP site. Because commands and status requests
# are initiated by the supervisor, only a limited set of tests can be automated by the validator.
